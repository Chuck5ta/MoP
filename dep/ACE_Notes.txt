The default files for ACE_LITE were ammended in commit:

https://github.com/mangos/mangosDeps/commit/52e4c984dbca474f7a4353b444339067a95ea277

these will need to be reapplied should a new version be added.

Also the following two lines were amended to fix a connection bottleneck (especially on Linux):

ACE_DEFAULT_BACKLOG - Change 5 to 128
https://github.com/mangos/mangosDeps/blob/Rel21/acelite/ace/Default_Constants.h#L81

ACE_DEFAULT_ASYNCH_BACKLOG - Change 5 to 128
https://github.com/mangos/mangosDeps/blob/Rel21/acelite/ace/Default_Constants.h#L85



Note:
On MacOS X, the ACE_UINT64_TYPE should be defined as follows in ace/config-macosx-leopard.h

#define ACE_UINT64_TYPE unsigned long long
