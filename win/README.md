# EasyBuild
---

**Easy Build is a MaNGOS dependancy checker and Cmake helper GUI.**

Run this from the win folder of a MaNGOS repository and it will check all the required libraries are installed and all required submodules are cloned correctly.

This ensures that the build process will find them and build correctly.

It also provides a GUI for the Cmake build options.
