Texts Documentation
===================
In order for scripts to have a centralized storage for texts, text tables have been
added to the database. Any script can access and use texts from these tables.

An additional table is available for custom scripts.

For each table ranges of valid identifiers have been define

* entry `-1` to `-999999`: reserved EventAI in *mangos*,
* entry `-1000000` to `-1999999`: script text entries,
* entry `-2000000` to `-2999999`: text entries for custom scripts,
* entry `-3000000` to `-3999999`: texts for scripted gossip texts.

Text entries not using identifiers from the defined ranges will result in startup
errors.

Database structure
------------------
`custom_texts`, `gossip_texts`, and `script_texts` share an indentical table
structure, thus making it very easy to add new text entries.

Field name      | Description
--------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
entry           | A unique *negative* identifier to the text entry.
content_default | The default text to be displayed in English.
content_loc1    | Korean localization of `content_default`.
content_loc2    | French localization of `content_default`.
content_loc3    | German localization of `content_default`.
content_loc4    | Chinese localization of `content_default`.
content_loc5    | Taiwanese localization of `content_default`.
content_loc6    | Spanish Spain localization of `content_default`.
content_loc7    | Spanish Latin America localization of `content_default`.
content_loc8    | Russian localization of `content_default`.
sound           | A sound from SoundEntries.dbc to be played.

language        | A text language from Languages.dbc

*Note*: `sound`, `type`, `language` and `emote` exist only in the tables
`script_texts` and `custom_texts`.

*Note*: Fields `content_loc1` to `content_loc8` are `NULL` values by default and
are handled by separate localization projects.
